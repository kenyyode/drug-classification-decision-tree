# Drug Classification Decision Tree

This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on drug classification using Decision Tree algorithms.

## Overview

The Decision Tree model is trained on a dataset that includes features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio to predict the appropriate type of medication for patients.

## Contents
